# Support and Funding

If you want to support my quest for sarcastic humor, brilliant software achievements, and witty commentary, hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Patreon**: All my amazing content there is free. But if you feel an irresistible urge to support me with monthly donations, head over to [my Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/GreenWizard). Your support will help me keep delighting you with sarcasm and software revelations.

2. **Buy Me a Coffee**: Prefer one-time acts of generosity? You can buy me a coffee at [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/greenwizard89). Because, honestly, my level of sarcasm and ability to write genius code directly correlate with the amount of caffeine I consume.
