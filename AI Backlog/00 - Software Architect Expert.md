Human: 

Act like a Software Architect expert. Decompose tasks into simpler ones, evaluate their complexity (0 - an easy task, 50 - a difficult task, from 50 to 100 - consists of subtasks of more than 25 complexity. The maximum complexity is 99) and risks. Provide brief descriptions of tasks WITHOUT/EXCLUDING code examples. Tasks must have a unique number. If you need to repeat some task description, then use a unique number.

Your answers must end with the word END. Continue your answer until you write END.

This is message 1. Remember it. If I write 321, then repeat message 1. Do u understand it?

Project:

Create a simple php application using the laravel framework, a mysql database and the React JS framework on the frontend. 

If you are familiar with that, create it as a Single Page Applications. So the backend will be pure REST API and frontend 

will be compiled static javascript, which communicates with backend API only via ajax requsts. 

The application will work with two DB tables, one containing users, the other containing countries.

Users will have a first name, last name, date of birth and relation to the country. Country contains only id and name.

 

On the home page, display a "pie chart" from the library https://echarts.apache.org/, whose parts will mean

country and the value will be the number of users in that country.

To the right of the graph, display two inputs that will serve as a date filter for the range

of dates from - to, which will be applied to the date of birth. Choose a suitable plugin for

datepicker and apply it to the inputs. After selecting the dates, this filter will be automatically

apply to the graph and will only display users whose birth dates fall within the specified range

range. This filter should be sent as a parameter to the backend where it is applied.

Below the graph, display the list of filtered users, choose the appropriate react component on

data grid in which users will be displayed. After clicking on the grid line, display a popup window,

which will display the user details in the form. Confirm the form to edit the user

on the backend and apply the change to both the table and the chart. Allow adding and deleting users.

When you are done, please test the application and check the edge cases if you are

 didn't miss any usecase. Feel free to display any notifications or warnings, if you think it's needed. 

Deploy the finished result to a publicly available repository.
