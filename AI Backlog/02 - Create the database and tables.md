Project:

Create a simple php application using the laravel framework, a mysql database and the React JS framework on the frontend. 

If you are familiar with that, create it as a Single Page Applications. So the backend will be pure REST API and frontend 

will be compiled static javascript, which communicates with backend API only via ajax requsts. 

The application will work with two DB tables, one containing users, the other containing countries.

Users will have a first name, last name, date of birth and relation to the country. Country contains only id and name.

 

On the home page, display a "pie chart" from the library https://echarts.apache.org/, whose parts will mean

country and the value will be the number of users in that country.

To the right of the graph, display two inputs that will serve as a date filter for the range

of dates from - to, which will be applied to the date of birth. Choose a suitable plugin for

datepicker and apply it to the inputs. After selecting the dates, this filter will be automatically

apply to the graph and will only display users whose birth dates fall within the specified range

range. This filter should be sent as a parameter to the backend where it is applied.

Below the graph, display the list of filtered users, choose the appropriate react component on

data grid in which users will be displayed. After clicking on the grid line, display a popup window,

which will display the user details in the form. Confirm the form to edit the user

on the backend and apply the change to both the table and the chart. Allow adding and deleting users.

When you are done, please test the application and check the edge cases if you are

 didn't miss any usecase. Feel free to display any notifications or warnings, if you think it's needed. 

Deploy the finished result to a publicly available repository.

AI: 

To create the database and tables for the application using Laravel, you can use migrations. Here are the steps to create the tables:

1. Create a new migration file for the users table by running the command 

```

php artisan make:migration create_users_table

```

1. Open the migration file in the 

```

database/migrations

```

 directory and add the fields and constraints for the users table. You can use the 

```

Schema

```

 facade to define the fields and constraints. For example:

```

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration

{

    public function up()

    {

        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

            $table->increments('id');

            $table->string('first_name');

            $table->string('last_name');

            $table->date('date_of_birth');

            $table->integer('country_id')->unsigned();

            $table->foreign('country_id')->references('id')->on('countries');

            $table->timestamps();

        });

    }

    

    public function down()

    {

        Schema::dropIfExists('users');

    }

}

```

1. Create a new migration file for the countries table by running the command 

```

php artisan make:migration create_countries_table

```

1. Open the migration file in the 

```

database/migrations

```

 directory and add the fields and constraints for the countries table. For example:

```

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateCountriesTable extends Migration

{

    public function up()

    {

        Schema::create('countries', function (Blueprint $table) {

            $table->increments('id');

            $table->string('name');

            $table->timestamps();

        });

    }

    

    public function down()

    {

        Schema::dropIfExists('countries');

    }

}

```

1. Run the migration command 

```

php artisan migrate

```

 to create the tables in the database

Note: You should have the correct database settings in your `.env` file and you should also have created the database.

Once you have done this, you can use the eloquent ORM to interact with the tables, create, read, update and delete records.

list unused by app fields

---

AI: 

The tables created for the application should only contain the fields necessary for the functionality of the application. However, if there are any fields that are not used by the application, they can be considered as unused fields.

For example, if the application does not use the "updated_at" field in the users and countries table, it can be considered as an unused field. Additionally, if the application doesn't need the "country_id" field in the users table, it can be considered as an unused field.

It's important to note that some fields such as "created_at" and "updated_at" are automatically added by laravel and are not necessary for the application but they are useful for tracking when the record is created or updated.

In summary, the unused fields by the app:

- updated_at in users and countries table

- country_id in the users table if not used

- created_at in users and countries table if not used.

Human: 

country_id used. rmv unused f cde

AI: 

To remove the unused fields from the code, you can take the following steps:

1. Open the migration file for the users table and remove the "updated_at" field and "created_at" field if not used.

```

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration

{

    public function up()

    {

        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

            $table->increments('id');

            $table->string('first_name');

            $table->string('last_name');

            $table->date('date_of_birth');

            $table->integer('country_id')->unsigned();

            $table->foreign('country_id')->references('id')->on('countries');

        });

    }

    

    public function down()

    {

        Schema::dropIfExists('users');

    }

}

```

1. Open the migration file for the countries table and remove the "updated_at" field and "created_at" field if not used.

```

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateCountriesTable extends Migration

{

    public function up()

    {

        Schema::create('countries', function (Blueprint $table) {

            $table->increments('id');

            $table->string('name');

        });

    }

    

    public function down()

    {

        Schema::dropIfExists('countries');

    }

}

```

1. Run the command 

```

php artisan migrate:reset

```

 to reset the migration and then 

```

php artisan migrate

```

 to create the tables again.

It's important to note that if you are removing the "created_at" and "updated_at" fields from the tables, you should also remove the timestamps property from the model class.

By removing the unused fields, you will improve the performance and readability of your code and database.

It's always good to keep your codebase and database clean and organized. This will make it easier to understand, maintain and optimize your application.

we use laravel 8

write a test for country

---

AI: 

In Laravel 8, testing can be done using the built-in testing tools such as PHPUnit. Here is an example of how you can write a test for the country model:

1. 

Create a new test file for the country model by running the command `php artisan make:test CountryTest`

1. 

Open the test file in the `tests` directory and import the necessary classes and dependencies. For example:

```

use App\Models\Country;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithFaker;

use Tests\TestCase;

class CountryTest extends TestCase

{

    use RefreshDatabase;

    use WithFaker;

```

1. Write a test to check if a country can be created and saved to the database. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeCreated()

    {

        $name = $this->faker->word;

        $country = new Country(['name' => $name]);

        $this->assertTrue($country->save());

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('countries', ['name' => $name]);

    }

```

1. Write a test to check if a country can be updated and saved to the database. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeUpdated()

    {

        $country = factory(Country::class)->create();

        $newName = $this->faker->word;

        $country->name = $newName;

        $this->assertTrue($country->save());

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('countries', ['name' => $newName]);

    }

```

1. Write a test to check if a country can be deleted from the database. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeDeleted()

    {

        $country = factory(Country::class)->create();

        $this->assertTrue($country->delete());

        $this->assertDatabaseMissing('countries', ['id' => $country->id]);

    }

```

1. Run the tests with the command 

```

phpunit

```

In this example, We are using the `RefreshDatabase` trait to reset the database after each test, and the `WithFaker` trait to generate fake data for the tests. Additionally, we are using the `factory` method to create a new instance of the country model.

It's important to note that you should test all the functionality of the country model and any other model you have in your application. This will help ensure that the application is working as expected and will help you catch any bugs or issues early on.

By writing tests, you will be able to make sure that the application is working correctly and that any changes you make to the code don't break the functionality.

It's also important to keep your test updated, and add new tests as you add new functionality to the application.

new format:

    public function testCountryCanBeCreated()

    {

        $name = $this->faker->word;

        $country = Country::factory()->make(['name' => $name]);

        $this->assertTrue($country->save());

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('countries', ['name' => $name]);

    }

upd code of tsts

---

AI: 

To update the code of the tests to use the new format, you can make the following changes:

1. In the 

```

testCountryCanBeCreated

```

 method, instead of creating a new instance of the country model and setting the name, you can use the 

```

factory

```

 method to create a new instance of the model with the specified attributes. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeCreated()

    {

        $name = $this->faker->word;

        $country = Country::factory()->make(['name' => $name]);

        $this->assertTrue($country->save());

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('countries', ['name' => $name]);

    }

```

1. In the 

```

testCountryCanBeUpdated

```

 method, instead of creating a new instance of the country model using the 

```

factory

```

 method, you can use the 

```

create

```

 method to create a new instance and save it to the database. Then you can update the name and save the model again. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeUpdated()

    {

        $country = Country::factory()->create();

        $newName = $this->faker->word;

        $country->name = $newName;

        $this->assertTrue($country->save());

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('countries', ['name' => $newName]);

    }

```

1. In the 

```

testCountryCanBeDeleted

```

 method, instead of creating a new instance of the country model using the 

```

factory

```

 method, you can use the 

```

create

```

 method to create a new instance and save it to the database. Then you can delete the model and assert that it is no longer in the database. For example:

```

    public function testCountryCanBeDeleted()

    {

        $country = Country::factory()->create();

        $this->assertTrue($country->delete());

        $this->assertDatabaseMissing('countries', ['id' => $country->id]);

    }

```

By updating the code of the tests to use the new format, you will be able to create and update instances of the country model more easily and in a more readable way.

It's important to note that when you run the tests, the `RefreshDatabase` trait will automatically reset the database after each test, so you don't have to worry about cleaning up the data.

It's always good to keep your tests updated and to follow the best practices of your framework. This will make it easier to understand, maintain and optimize your application.
