## Notes about disability & AI

As a non-native English speaker with a physical disability (a severe form of cerebral palsy), it can be challenging for me to communicate effectively and efficiently even with a text. However, with the help of AI, specifically ChatGPT and Copilot, I am able to overcome these obstacles and bring my ideas to life.

One of the most significant benefits of using ChatGPT and Copilot is their ability to understand not only English but also other languages and even intentional errors, which helps to speed up and simplify the writing process. For example, I can minimize physical effort, just type "mk react cmp Hdr, w logo n mnu. use bstrp" and receive a good starting point. This approach eliminates physical challenges for me and leaves only mental work (check results, incorporate them, figure out what to do next, etc.) that I find much easier.

Also, I often had to describe complex concepts in a short amount of time, and because of my physical limitations, I had to use a simplified language. This often led to misunderstandings and less-than-optimal results. Moreover, it can be very challenging for me, because it may require finding correct wording, checking for typos, etc. But AI helps a lot to overcome these challenges.

While ChatGPT and Copilot are incredibly helpful, they are not perfect and require some manual input to ensure the best results. Despite this, their ability to understand and interpret my intentions saves me time and energy, making it easier for me to create and develop my ideas.

Overall, I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way people with disabilities work and interact with the world around them. While there are still challenges to overcome, the benefits of using AI to augment our abilities are significant and undeniable.
