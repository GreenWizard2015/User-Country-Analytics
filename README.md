# User Country Analytics

Initial project description:

> Create a simple php application using the laravel framework, a mysql database and the React JS framework on the frontend. If you are familiar with that, create it as a Single Page Applications. So the backend will be pure REST API and frontend will be compiled static javascript, which communicates with backend API only via ajax requsts. 
> 
> The application will work with two DB tables, one containing users, the other containing countries.
> 
> Users will have a first name, last name, date of birth and relation to the country. Country contains only id and name.
> 
> On the home page, display a "pie chart" from the library https://echarts.apache.org/, whose parts will mean country and the value will be the number of users in that country.
> 
> To the right of the graph, display two inputs that will serve as a date filter for the range of dates from - to, which will be applied to the date of birth. Choose a suitable plugin for datepicker and apply it to the inputs. After selecting the dates, this filter will be automatically apply to the graph and will only display users whose birth dates fall within the specified range. This filter should be sent as a parameter to the backend where it is applied.
> 
> Below the graph, display the list of filtered users, choose the appropriate react component on data grid in which users will be displayed. After clicking on the grid line, display a popup window, which will display the user details in the form. Confirm the form to edit the user on the backend and apply the change to both the table and the chart. Allow adding and deleting users.
> 
> When you are done, please test the application and check the edge cases if you are didn't miss any usecase. Feel free to display any notifications or warnings, if you think it's needed. 
> 
> Deploy the finished result to a publicly available repository.

The project started with a minimal experience in Laravel and React/Redux, but with a general idea of the desired outcome and code quality. I added to the project's requirements the presence of tests and maximizing the use of AI in development. Despite using AI assistants like ChatGPT and Copilot, the ecosystem of Laravel and React/Redux turned out to be more challenging than expected, leading to the need to fix many things to follow best practices. The experience was valuable and it highlighted that while AI can significantly increase productivity, it cannot replace the need for expert knowledge and experience if you are pushing the limits and don't accept low-quality results.
